# E-Commerce-Segmentation-Prediction-Project

Selected Project: E-commerce Customer Segmentation and Prediction
Develop a robust customer segmentation model and a predictive classifier to categorize customers based on their purchasing patterns. This will enable the company to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize inventory management.

Project Overview:
This project aims to enhance marketing strategies and customer retention for an e-commerce company by gaining a deeper understanding of their customer base based on their purchasing patter. By leveraging machine learning, the project seeks to segment customers and predict future purchasing behavior. The goal is to develop a robust customer segmentation model and a predictive classifier to categorize customers based on their purchasing patterns, enabling the company to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize inventory management.
•InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction
•tockCode: Product code
•Description: Product name
•Quantity: Number of items purchased
•InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
•UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
•CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
•Country: Country where the transaction occurred

Project Benefits:
Enhanced Customer Segmentation: Identify and categorize customers based on purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
